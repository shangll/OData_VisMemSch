Thank you for taking part in this study! In this study, you
will memorize 1, 2, 4, or 8 images of objects and then
search a stream of visual displays for any of objects you
memorized before. Totally, you will perform 8 blocks
each of which consists of 3 phases:

1) Memorizing phase (to memorize 1, 2, 4, or 8 images of objects)
2) Testing phase (to comfirm you remember these objects indeed)
3) Searching phase (to decide on whether the image presented on
screen is the memorized one)

Please press              , we will show you an example.


---------------------------------
The fishhook comes from memory set. So you need
to memorize it.






In formal experiment, it will be presented for 3 sec,
and then disappears automatically.

But now, you need to press               to continue.


---------------------------------
When you finish memorizing, you will move on testing phase.
The objects will be presented on screen one by one. You need
to decide if the object presented is that you just memorized
lile this:







Please press                 to continue.


---------------------------------
Then, after two testing, we confirm that you have
remembered them indeed. You are presented a stream
of displays containing a pair of images.

These pairs should in principle contain an object
from memory set like this:





Press               if the pair of images contains an object
from memory set. Then you will move on next trial.


---------------------------------
Sometimes, the pair may contain nothing from memory
set (both are new objects outside memory set) like this:







Press         to continue if there is no any old object
in the pair.


---------------------------------
Great! Now you can do some practice to know better
about the experimental procedure.

The practice is much shorter than the real task.
In real task, you will perform 8 blocks each of which
contains over 100 image pairs.
In practice, however, only 20 trials are included in block.

Please press              to continue.


---------------------------------
In both practice and the real task, the image pairs are
presented very briefly, so you have to stay alert!

We will present the hit rates of both old and
new pairs at the end of each block.

Try to keep both                    !

Please press              to continue.


---------------------------------
Altogether, in this study, you are required to memorize
1, 2, 4, or 8 images first                                  , and then
after at least two             , you will move to                     
                 in which you need to search a stream of visual
displays to decide if the pair contains old object or not.

Please press              to continue.


---------------------------------
If there is any object from memory set, press             ;
if there are no images from memory set, press     .

The images are presented briefly in searching phase.
But do not worried. You still have enough time to
respond as quickly and accurately as possible.


Ready?
Please              to practise.






Now, the formal experiment will start.

Please remember:

1) At both testing phase and searching phase, press               
if you detect any old object from memory set;
press        if the objects are outside memory set.

2) At searching phase, do          blink when the images are
presented. You are only allowed to blink after your response.

Ready?
Press              to start your experiment!
